fann_get_activation_steepness -- Returns the activation steepness for supplied
neuron and layer number

  float fann_get_activation_steepness(resource ann, int layer, int neuron)~

Get the activation steepness for neuron number neuron in layer number layer,
counting the input layer as layer 0.

It is not possible to get activation steepness for the neurons in the input
layer.

The steepness of an activation function says something about how fast the
activation function goes from the minimum to the maximum. A high value for the
activation function will also give a more agressive training.

When training neural networks where the output values should be at the
extremes (usually 0 and 1, depending on the activation function), a steep
activation function can be used (e.g. 1.0).

The default activation steepness is 0.5.

Neural network resource.

Layer number

Neuron number

The activation steepness for the neuron or -1 if the neuron is not defined in
the neural network, or &false; on error.
