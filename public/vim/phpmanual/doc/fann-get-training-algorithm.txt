fann_get_training_algorithm -- Returns the training algorithm

  int fann_get_training_algorithm(resource ann)~

Returns the training algorithm. This training algorithm is used by
|fann_train_on_data| and associated functions.

Note that this algorithm is also used during |fann_cascadetrain_on_data|,
although only FANN_TRAIN_RPROP and FANN_TRAIN_QUICKPROP is allowed during
cascade training.

Neural network resource.

Training algorithm constant, or &false; on error.
