fann_create_standard -- Creates a standard fully connected backpropagation
neural network

  resource fann_create_standard(int num_layers, int num_neurons1, int num_neurons2 [, int ...])~

Creates a standard fully connected backpropagation neural network.

There will be a bias neuron in each layer (except the output layer), and this
bias neuron will be connected to all neurons in the next layer. When running
the network, the bias nodes always emits 1.

To destroy a neural network use the |fann_destroy| function.

The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.

Number of neurons in the first layer.

Number of neurons in the second layer.

Number of neurons in other layers.

Returns a neural network resource on success, or &false; on error.
