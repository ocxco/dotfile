fann_get_cascade_num_candidates -- Returns the number of candidates used
during training

  int fann_get_cascade_num_candidates(resource ann)~

The number of candidates used during training (calculated by multiplying
|fann_get_cascade_activation_functions_count|,
|fann_get_cascade_activation_steepnesses_count| and
|fann_get_cascade_num_candidate_groups|).

The actual candidates is defined by the
|fann_get_cascade_activation_functions| and
|fann_get_cascade_activation_steepnesses| arrays. These arrays define the
activation functions and activation steepnesses used for the candidate
neurons. If there are 2 activation functions in the activation function array
and 3 steepnesses in the steepness array, then there will be 2x3=6 different
candidates which will be trained. These 6 different candidates can be copied
into several candidate groups, where the only difference between these groups
is the initial weights. If the number of groups is set to 2, then the number
of candidate neurons will be 2x3x2=12. The number of candidate groups is
defined by |fann_set_cascade_num_candidate_groups|.

The default number of candidates is 6x4x2 = 48

Neural network resource.

The number of candidates used during training, or &false; on error.
