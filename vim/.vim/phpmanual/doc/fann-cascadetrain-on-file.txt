fann_cascadetrain_on_file -- Trains on an entire dataset read from file, for a
period of time using the Cascade2 training algorithm.

  bool fann_cascadetrain_on_file(resource ann, string filename, int max_neurons, int neurons_between_reports, float desired_error)~

Does the same as |fann_cascadetrain_on_data|, but reads the training data
directly from a file.

Neural network resource.

The maximum number of neurons to be added to neural network

The number of neurons between printing a status report to stdout. A value of
zero means no reports should be printed.

The number of neurons between printing a status report. A value of zero means
no reports should be printed.

The desired |fann_get_MSE| or |fann_get_bit_fail|, depending on which stop
function is chosen by |fann_set_train_stop_function|.

Returns &true; on success, or &false; otherwise.
