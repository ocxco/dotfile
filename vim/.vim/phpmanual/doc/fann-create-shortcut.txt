fann_create_shortcut -- Creates a standard backpropagation neural network
which is not fully connectected and has shortcut connections

  reference fann_create_shortcut(int num_layers, int num_neurons1, int num_neurons2 [, int ...])~

Creates a standard backpropagation neural network, which is not fully
connected and which also has shortcut connections.

Shortcut connections are connections that skip layers. A fully connected
network with shortcut connections, is a network where all neurons are
connected to all neurons in later layers. Including direct connections from
the input layer to the output layer.

The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.

Number of neurons in the first layer.

Number of neurons in the second layer.

Number of neurons in other layers.

Returns a neural network resource on success, or &false; on error.
