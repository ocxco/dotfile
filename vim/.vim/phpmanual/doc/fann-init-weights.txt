fann_init_weights -- Initialize the weights using Widrow + Nguyen’s
algorithm

  bool fann_init_weights(resource ann, resource train_data)~

Initialize the weights using Widrow + Nguyen’s algorithm.

This function behaves similarly to |fann_randomize_weights|. It will use the
algorithm developed by Derrick Nguyen and Bernard Widrow to set the weights in
such a way as to speed up training. This technique is not always successful,
and in some cases can be less efficient than a purely random initialization.

The algorithm requires access to the range of the input data (for example
largest and smallest input), and therefore accepts a second argument, data,
which is the training data that will be used to train the network.

Neural network resource.

Neural network training data resource.

Returns &true; on success, or &false; otherwise.
