fann_get_bit_fail_limit -- Returns the bit fail limit used during training

  float fann_get_bit_fail_limit(resource ann)~

Returns the bit fail limit used during training.

The bit fail limit is used during training where the stop function is set to
FANN_STOPFUNC_BIT.

The limit is the maximum accepted difference between the desired output and
the actual output during training. Each output that diverges more than this
limit is counted as an error bit. This difference is divided by two when
dealing with symmetric activation functions, so that symmetric and not
symmetric activation functions can use the same limit.

The default bit fail limit is 0.35.
