fann_train_on_file -- Trains on an entire dataset, which is read from file,
for a period of time

  bool fann_train_on_file(resource ann, string filename, int max_epochs, int epochs_between_reports, float desired_error)~

Trains on an entire dataset, which is read from file, for a period of time.

This training uses the training algorithm chosen by
|fann_set_training_algorithm| and the parameters set for these training
algorithms.

Neural network resource.

The file containing train data

The maximum number of epochs the training should continue

The number of epochs between calling a user function. A value of zero means
that user function is not called.

The desired |fann_get_MSE| or |fann_get_bit_fail|, depending on the stop
function chosen by |fann_set_train_stop_function|

Returns &true; on success, or &false; otherwise.
